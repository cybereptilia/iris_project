# Iris Project 🌸
This notebook explores the classic Iris dataset using **Scikit-Learn** and **TensorFlow**.  
It’s part of my exercises following *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow (3rd Edition)* by Aurélien Géron.

## Techniques Covered
- Data visualization (pair plots, histograms)
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Logistic Regression, KNN, and Softmax Classifiers
- Neural Network built with Keras
- Model evaluation and confusion matrix
